"""
Operator Overloading: We can support for any oprtators like +, - etc
in our class as well

Example :
- int class use + to add 2 nos
- str class use + to concatinate 2 strings

In python, we have special name given to each operator
like
+ = __add__
- = __sub__
If we want to support in our class then we need to write method for
each operator using special name
